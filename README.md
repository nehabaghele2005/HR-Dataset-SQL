üíº HR Dataset SQL Analysis Project

This project showcases the end-to-end analysis of an HR dataset using SQL. 
The analysis aims to extract meaningful insights about employees, 
organizational structure, performance, and attrition using SQL queries on structured data.





üìå Project Overview

Dataset Source: Employee dataset stored in SQL (uploaded and structured into employees table).
Database Used: MySQL

Objective: Perform data cleaning, transformation, and analysis to derive insights such as attrition rate, employee distribution, average salary, and more.





üóÇÔ∏è Dataset Fields

Key columns in the dataset include:

EmpID, Employee_Name, GenderID, DeptID, Salary, DOB, DateofHire, DateofTermination, Position, Department, ManagerName, PerformanceScore, EngagementSurvey, Absences, and others.
üîß SQL Operations Performed






üìå Database & Table Setup




CREATE DATABASE hrdata;
USE hrdata;
SELECT * FROM employees;
üìä Core Analysis Queries Total Current Employees





SELECT COUNT(*) AS Total_Current_Employees
FROM employees
WHERE DateofTermination = '';
Total Terminated Employees





SELECT COUNT(*) AS Total_Exited_Employees
FROM employees
WHERE DateofTermination != '';
Average Salary





SELECT AVG(Salary) AS Avg_Salary
FROM Employees;
Average Age of Employees





SELECT AVG(TIMESTAMPDIFF(YEAR,STR_TO_DATE(DOB,'%d-%m-%Y'),CURDATE())) AS Avg_Age
FROM Employees;
Average Years in Company





SELECT AVG(TIMESTAMPDIFF(YEAR,STR_TO_DATE(DateOfHire,'%d-%m-%Y'),CURDATE())) AS Avg_Years_in_Company
FROM Employees;





üßπ Data Cleaning & Transformation

Converted DOB, DateofHire, LastPerformanceReview_Date into proper DATE format.

Handled empty/null DateofTermination values.

Changed Salary data type to DECIMAL(10,2) for precision.

Added a new column EmployeeCurrentStatus to indicate current (1) or exited (0) employees.





ALTER TABLE employees
ADD EmployeeCurrentStatus INT;



UPDATE employees
SET EmployeeCurrentStatus = CASE
WHEN DateofTermination = '' THEN 1
ELSE 0
END;
üìà Attrition Rate Calculation



SELECT
(CAST(COUNT(CASE WHEN EmployeeCurrentStatus = 0 THEN 1 END) AS FLOAT)/COUNT(*))*100 AS Attrition_Rate
FROM employees;
üìä Additional Insights

Employees by Marital Status




SELECT MaritalDesc, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM Employees
GROUP BY MaritalDesc
ORDER BY count DESC;
Employees by Department



SELECT Department, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM Employees
GROUP BY Department
ORDER BY count DESC;
Employees by Position



SELECT Position, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM Employees
GROUP BY Position
ORDER BY count DESC;
Employees under Each Manager



SELECT ManagerName, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM Employees
GROUP BY ManagerName
ORDER BY count DESC;


üìå Sample Output Queries

SELECT * FROM employees LIMIT 5;
Last 5 Rows by EmpID

SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY EmpID DESC LIMIT 5;
